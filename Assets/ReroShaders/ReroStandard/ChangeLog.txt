Changelog:

1.0.8
Modified to change the render queue instead of switching shaders.
Fixed multi-editing.

1.0.7.b hotfix2
Fixed outline code errors with Unity fog.
Fixed "Inconsistent line endings" warning.

1.0.7.b
Stereo corrected stylized specular.
Fixed updater.

1.0.7a
Fixes various minor issues and a major one involving non important light attenuation.

1.0.7
Includes the "Advanced Channel Settings" features for each workflow
This allows you to select the channel that is read per map per PBR property enabling the use of packed texture maps
Test these out and let me know if something's wrong. Thanks
Re-implemented parralax relief mapping for height


1.0.6b
Fixed EVERYTHING ambient/diffuse related (for real this time)
Added support for scruffy's stupid vertex lights
Fixed my dumb implementation of reflection dimming causing attenuation to go haywire
Moved bits of code around to the include files where they actually belong instead of everything being in the BRDF one
Fixed my editor (again)

1.0.6a*
The "back to standard" update
Seeks to return the look of the shader in all cases to as close to standard as possible while retaining the fixes I've implemented over the shaders lifetime.
It's basically a re-work of a previous public version that resembled standard a lot more closely.
*I somehow reverted the diffuse banding fix so that's back as of now.

1.0.5b
Fixed light attenuation causing colored directional lighting to be read as shadow.
Fixed point lights being generally scuffed and not showing up.
Laughed at Scruffy's vertex lights.
Fixed "dusty stereo lighting" bug in VR

1.0.5
Fixed rim light and glossy reflections not darkening properly
Made glossy reflections directional when rim light is directional
New approach to the custom ramp that makes it more easily stylized
Fixed point lights being attenuated in unexpected ways
Various other things

1.0.4a
Fixed the spelling of the word "Outlines" in the editor

1.0.4
changed height maps to parallax occlusion (relief) maps. see: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=ReliefSpecular#ShaderLab_-_ReliefSpecular.shader
Minor rewrite of the updater

1.0.3c
Fixed the rim multi-slider being broken
